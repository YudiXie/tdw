# Drop

`from tdw.replicant.actions.drop import Drop`

Drop a held object.

The action ends when the object stops moving or the number of consecutive `communicate()` calls since dropping the object exceeds `self.max_num_frames`.

When an object is dropped, it is made non-kinematic. Any objects contained by the object are parented to it and also made non-kinematic. For more information regarding containment in TDW, [read this](../../../lessons/semantic_states/containment.md).

***

## Fields

- `arm` The [`Arm`](../arm.md) holding the object.

- `object_id` The ID of the held object.

- `object_position` The current position of the object.

- `max_num_frames` Wait this number of `communicate()` calls maximum for the object to stop moving before ending the action.

- `frame_count` The current frame.

- `offset` Prior to being dropped, set the object's positional offset. This can be a float (a distance along the object's forward directional vector). Or it can be a dictionary or numpy array (a world space position).

- `status` [The current status of the action.](../action_status.md) By default, this is `ongoing` (the action isn't done).

- `initialized` If True, the action has initialized. If False, the action will try to send `get_initialization_commands(resp)` on this frame.

- `done` If True, this action is done and won't send any more commands.

## Functions

#### \_\_init\_\_

**`Drop(arm, dynamic, max_num_frames, offset)`**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| arm |  Arm |  | The [`Arm`](../arm.md) holding the object. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |
| max_num_frames |  int |  | Wait this number of `communicate()` calls maximum for the object to stop moving before ending the action. |
| offset |  Union[float, np.ndarray, Dict[str, float] |  | Prior to being dropped, set the object's positional offset. This can be a float (a distance along the object's forward directional vector). Or it can be a dictionary or numpy array (a world space position). |

#### get_initialization_commands

**`self.get_initialization_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  ReplicantStatic |  | The [`ReplicantStatic`](../replicant_static.md) data that doesn't change after the Replicant is initialized. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | An [`ImageFrequency`](../image_frequency.md) value describing how often image data will be captured. |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to initialize this action.

#### get_ongoing_commands

**`self.get_ongoing_commands(resp, static, dynamic)`**

Evaluate an action per-frame to determine whether it's done.


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  ReplicantStatic |  | The [`ReplicantStatic`](../replicant_static.md) data that doesn't change after the Replicant is initialized. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |

_Returns:_  A list of commands to send to the build to continue the action.

#### get_end_commands

**`self.get_end_commands(resp, static, dynamic, image_frequency)`**


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resp |  List[bytes] |  | The response from the build. |
| static |  ReplicantStatic |  | The [`ReplicantStatic`](../replicant_static.md) data that doesn't change after the Replicant is initialized. |
| dynamic |  ReplicantDynamic |  | The [`ReplicantDynamic`](../replicant_dynamic.md) data that changes per `communicate()` call. |
| image_frequency |  ImageFrequency |  | An [`ImageFrequency`](../image_frequency.md) value describing how often image data will be captured. |

_Returns:_  A list of commands that must be sent to end any action.
